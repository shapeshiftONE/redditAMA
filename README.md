# ShapeShiftDAO /r/CryptoCurrency Reddit AMA Transparency Report

## Rewards Allocation & Distribution Method

The following was pre-determined before the start of the AMA and can be confirmed by r/CryptoCurrency moderators. 

- $3,000 in FOX Tokens Allocated to the 50 highest scored (by upvotes) top-level comments
- Rewards calculated in proportion to the comment score divided by the total score
`(eligible comment score / Σ total eligible comments' score) * 3000`
- Snapshot of top-level comments taken roughly 48 hours after AMA's end to allow for karma scores to settle down. However, due to Reddit's anti-botting algorithm, the score may still swing ±1 depending on time, cache, and who's viewing.
- The snapshot script can be found in AMA.py

## NFT Rewards

- Roughly 10 NFTs will be minted for participants selected by each DAO workstream.
- Each workstream has 24 hours from the time of this posting to select their winners. For NFT minting there is no restrictions on sub-comments or upvote score.

## POAPs

- 1000 POAPs were pre-minted prior to the beginning of the AMA, and claiming method is currently being devised.

# Final Results

- Distribution and TXID has been uploaded `distributionR1.csv`
- In two weeks another attempt will be made to contact the receptients that have not yet claimed their rewards.
